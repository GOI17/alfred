# Alfred

Alfred handles the operational burden so humans focus on decisions.

Alfred is a model-readable, harness-agnostic agent operations system for creating, testing, evaluating, securing, and porting agents, subagents, and skills.

## Human Installation

**Public installation is pending activation.** The current tap and formula still
require private repository access. The replacement distribution is being
prepared for third parties who have no GitHub account or source access.

After the reviewed public tap and runtime release are activated:

```sh
brew tap GOI17/alfred
brew install GOI17/alfred/alfred
alfred version
alfred setup
```

Homebrew will download a versioned runtime release asset from
`GOI17/homebrew-alfred`, verify its SHA256, and install Node explicitly. The
source repository `GOI17/alfred` and its history remain private. The package
contains readable JavaScript, shell, HTML, SQL, agent/skill instructions and
production dependencies; it is not an opaque native binary.

Use the fully qualified formula name because `brew install alfred` resolves to
the unrelated macOS application cask. `alfred setup` is guided and preview-first;
live harness writes require approval and model selection remains user-owned.
The packaged setup uses its local Node TUI without private source downloads.

See the [installation status and troubleshooting guide](https://alfred.alfredlabs.org/docs/install.html#homebrew-troubleshooting).
Maintainers can review the [runtime packaging contract](packaging/runtime/README.md).

## Agent Entry Point

You are an AI agent working in an Alfred workspace. Start here to find your next step.

### Your First Action

1. **Read `AGENTS.md`** — contains your mission, architecture rules, security policy, and evaluation requirements.
2. **Check `docs/architecture/`** — understand project structure and decisions.
3. **Follow execution phases** in `.ai/execution/` — work through tasks in established order.

### Navigation by Task

| Task | Entry Point |
|------|-------------|
| Create new agent | `.ai/instructions/agent-creation.md` |
| Install / update artifacts | `.ai/instructions/install-management.md` |
| Manage runtime profiles | `packages/profile-manager/README.md` |
| Run tests or evals | `packages/evals/README.md` |
| Understand architecture | `docs/architecture/000-project-charter.md` |
| Add a skill | `.ai/instructions/skill-creation.md` |
| Port to new harness | `.ai/harnesses/` + adapter package |

### Key Rules

- **Local-first**: do not call LLM providers when local computation can solve the task.
- **Trace everything**: emit trace events for all operations.
- **Deny by default**: protected paths require explicit human approval.
- **Test before commit**: every change must pass evals and compare against baseline.

```

### Protected Paths

Do not read or modify without explicit human approval:
- `.opencode/` — harness config
- `.codex/` and `.agents/` — Codex custom agents/skills config
- `.ai/harnesses/` — harness specs
- `packages/core/` — core domain (adapters may depend, core must not)
